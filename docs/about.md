## About RingCentral Labs

RingCentral Labs solutions are a set of free, customizable, curated solutions built by RingCentral developers. They are designed to provide finished end-user solutions that solve common problems. RingCentral Labs apps are free to use, but are not official products, and should be considered community projects - these apps are not officially tested or documented.
